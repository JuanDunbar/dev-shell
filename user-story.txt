$ dev-shell
I see you don't have a ~/.dev-shell directory, lets get started

What directory do you want to mount into the development shell? (Where you keep your code)
> /Users/thrawn/Development

I see you have GOPATH defined, Inject GOPATH into dev-shell?
[Y/N]> Y

What public key should I use to secure the ssh container (Leave this empty and I'll generate one in ~/.dev-shell to use)
> /Users/thrawn/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

== Pull the image or create the image ==

## TODO: How to SSH into the container (Loadbalancer, or kubectl proxy)
Third party IDE's can SSH into the shell container via port 123124 `ssh -P localhost:123124`

## Customizing dev-shell

## Modify the shell image
edit ~/.dev-shell/Dockerfile then run `dev-shell build`

## Customize the k8 deploy
edit ~/.dev-shell/shell.yaml then run `dev-shell deploy`
- or -
re-run the quetionaire with `dev-shell config`

Your shell is ready....
